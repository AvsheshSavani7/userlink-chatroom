This key is necessary for authenticating your requests to OpenAI's services.\n\n3. **Install OpenAI SDK**:  \n   If you're using Node.js, you can install the OpenAI SDK via npm with the command:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install openai\n   ```\n   \n4. **API Setup in Code**:  \n   Here's a simple setup example in JavaScript:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const { OpenAI } = require(\"openai\");\n\n   const createOpenAIClient = () => {\n     const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';  // Replace with your actual OpenAI API Key\n     return new OpenAI({\n       apiKey,\n       dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true, // Use in browser (only in dev environments)\n     });\n   };\n\n   const openai = createOpenAIClient();\n   ```\n\n5. **Make an API Call**:  \n   To interact with the OpenAI models, you'll use the chat endpoint. Here is an example for making a request:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const askQuestion = async (question) => {\n     try {\n       const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n         model: 'gpt-4',  // You can choose 'gpt-3.5-turbo' as well\n         messages: [\n           { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },\n           { role: 'user', content: question }\n         ],\n       });\n\n       console.log('Answer:', response.choices[0].message.content);\n     } catch (error) {\n       console.error(\"Error:\", error);\n     }\n   };\n\n   // Example usage\n   askQuestion(\"What is the capital of France?\");\n   ```\n\nFollowing these steps will have you set up with OpenAI quickly, allowing you to start making API calls for question-answering or other tasks【5:0†openai_question_answering_guide.txt】.",
